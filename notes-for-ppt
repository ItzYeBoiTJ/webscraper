Slide 1: Title Slide
Project Name: Real-Time OEM Vulnerability Tracking Tool
Hackathon: CODE NEURAL '25
Team: Tarnished

Slide 2: Problem Statement & Solution
* Problem Statement:
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) like Dell, NVIDIA, and Intel release security advisories for hardware and software vulnerabilities. However, organizations struggle to:
1 Track vulnerabilities in real time from multiple sources.
2 Prioritize critical vulnerabilities that impact their systems.
3 Receive alerts before an exploit occurs.

* Our Solution:
1 A real-time web scraping tool that fetches security vulnerabilities from Dell’s Security Advisory Page & NVD Database.
2 Stores vulnerabilities in a database and provides an API to access them.
3 Ranks vulnerabilities by severity (High, Medium, Low).
4 Displays data on a dashboard for easy tracking & alerts.

Slide 3: Methodology & Workflow
1 Data Collection:

Fetch vulnerabilities from Dell Security Page & NVD API.
Use web scraping (Selenium, BeautifulSoup) & API calls to extract data.
2 Data Processing & Storage:

Clean and structure the data.
Store in a MongoDB database.
3 Backend API Development:

Develop Flask API to provide searchable & filterable vulnerability data.
4 Frontend Dashboard (Optional):

Display vulnerabilities in a simple, interactive UI.
Search, filter, and sort by severity & OEM.
5 Alerts & Notifications (Future Scope):

Send email or Slack alerts for critical vulnerabilities.


Slide 4: Impact & Benefits
 *Why is this important?
1 Helps security teams react faster to OEM vulnerabilities.
2 Automates tracking instead of manual searches.
3 Prioritizes threats, reducing cybersecurity risks.
4 Scalable – Can integrate more OEMs & AI-based risk assessment in the future.


Slide 5: Conclusion & Next Steps
* Current Achievements:
✔ Successfully scraped NVD & Dell vulnerabilities.
✔ API is ready to serve real-time data.

* Future Improvements:
✔ Add more OEM sources (NVIDIA, HP, etc.).
✔ Implement AI-based threat prioritization.
✔ Integrate email alerts for critical vulnerabilities.

Thank You!
